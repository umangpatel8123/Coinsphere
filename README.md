-Ethereum Transfer Website

This is a simple website for transferring Ethereum cryptocurrency between two addresses. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and interacts with the Ethereum network using the Web3.js library.

Getting Started
To get started with the Ethereum Transfer Website, you will need to have an MetaMask wallet with some Ether in it. You can create an Ethereum wallet using various online services like MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, or other Ethereum wallets. But we used only MetaMask here.

Once you have an Ethereum wallet, you will need to connect it to the website. The website currently supports connecting to the Ethereum network using the MetaMask browser extension. To connect to the website using MetaMask, simply install the MetaMask browser extension and follow the prompts to set up your account.

Using the Website
To use the website, follow these simple steps:

1. Enter the sender and recipient Ethereum addresses.
2. Enter the amount of Ether to transfer.
3. Click the "Send Ether" button.
4. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
Once the transaction is confirmed on the Ethereum network, the Ether will be transferred from the sender address to the recipient address.

The Transaction History will be shown in the bottom with TimeStamp.
